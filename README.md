Level editor for a game I never made

A few years ago I wanted to make a top-down game called Gingrich, and I decided to make the level editor first for whatever reason. I never made the actual game because I got bored with it.

The cool thing about this level editor is that you can add your own items and "item packs" to it. You create a folder in data/scripts, and you add ".item" files to it formatted like the ones in data/scripts/devpack. You create "loadscripts.txt" and list the paths to all the .item files, and you add a .info file.

When you create a level, it is saved to data/levels in a folder.
The "Load Level" button doesn't do anything because I never added a way to load levels.
